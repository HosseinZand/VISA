My 3D sculpture is related to my project 2, which was created to bring awareness to all the trash dumping that 
          goes on in the ocean.  When you look at specifically what is being dumped, many times you will find disposable
          containers, like water bottles, plastic bags, or food wrappers.  When we throw away items like that, we are not really
          sure where they will end up.  If anything, we are simply happy to be ignorant of where all this trash is going.
          I combined a McDonald's happy meal, which is a disposable food container, and combined it with a mother and baby turtle
          sculpture.  There is so much trash in the ocean that it is literally becoming part of the creatures that inhabit it.
          Not to mention, there is somewhat of a sad irony in that a happy meal, meant for children, is what is damaging this turtle
          and its offspring.
