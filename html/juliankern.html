            I created a 3D sculpture that is trying to draw attention to all trash that has been dumped into the
            ocean.
            When you look at what specific items are being dumped, you realize that disposable items make up a large
            portion
            of the offending materials. These are things like drinking straws, water bottles, food wrappers, and
            plastic bags.
            Many of these items are things we do not give a second thought to when we throw them away. For my 3D
            sculpture,
            I combined a sculpt of a turtle with its baby and a happy meal container. What I want to say with my
            piece is that
            there is so much trash in the ocean that it is literally becoming part of the sea animals. I think there
            is also a
            sad irony that this happy meal, meant for children, is what’s poisoning this turtle and its child.
