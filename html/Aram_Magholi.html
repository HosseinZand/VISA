            We are living in an interesting time. Now it is 2020, and the people are very proud of what they have
            reached from technology to medicine all around the world, but they just figured out they have not done
            enough! The world has been dealing with the Corona Virus for about four months, but there is no cure for it.
            The only thing we know is hand washing, and the use of hand sanitizers is vital for infection prevention.
            The fact of getting sick from our hands has been harming our brains. We have created a monster looking hands
            in our minds, and it scares us more and more every day.
