            I wanted to create a 3D object or objects that both resembled a previous project in which I created a video
            that showed how to wash ones hands, as well as
            a piece that speaks about what is currently going on in todays society. With the coronavirus gripping our
            lives and forcing us to stay inside, I wanted to make a piece
            that showed one of the mantras we all have seemed to take very seriously: washing our hands. Something that
            was once so mundane and every day is now at the forefront of
            our lives.
