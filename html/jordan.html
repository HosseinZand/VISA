            For our exhibition, we decided to display potential realities that our generation may have to face in the
            future. This exhibition explores the apocalyptic possibilities that humans may have to face; specifically a
            nuclear instigated apocalypse and an artificial intelligence instigated apocalypse. Our exhibition is thus
            split to two sides and the gallery buildings created are themed for each scenario we are creating. The
            nuclear apocalyptic side consists of a damaged building with holes and cracks whereas the artificial
            intelligence side features a more futuristic, sleek building style. On both sides of the gallery, there are
            two dimensional works on the walls that serve as windows for the reality of that side. The windows show a
            scene one could see on the outside of this building that "exixts" in that potential reality. The galllery
            space itself as well as the works are merged in this way to show the viewer the dangers that are relevant
            not only to the future generations, but also this generation.
